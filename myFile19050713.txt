['About Tix.py\n' '-----------\n' 'Tix.py is based on an idea of Jean-Marc Lugrin (lugrin@ms.com) who wrote\n' 'pytix (another Python-Tix marriage). Tix widgets are an attractive and\n' 'useful extension to Tk. See http://tix.sourceforge.net\n' 'for more details about Tix and how to get it.\n' 'Features:\n' '\t1) It is almost complete.\n' '\t2) Tix widgets are represented by classes in Python. Sub-widgets\n' '\t   are members of the mega-widget class. For example if a\n' '\t   particular TixWidget (e.g. ScrolledText) has an embedded widget\n' '\t   (Text in this case) it is possible to call the methods of the\n' '\t   child directly.\n' '\t3) The members of the class are created automatically. In the case\n' '\t   of widgets like ButtonBox the members are added dynamically.\n' '\n']
